## Introduction

Heart disease is a significant health concern globally, and predictive modeling can play a crucial role in early detection and intervention. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is from 1995. It contains a variety of features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more. The target variable is the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed. Additionally, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

```bash
jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
```

or

```bash
python heart_disease_prediction.py
```

## Analysis

The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of regression models from scikit-learn. The models used include [list the regression models used].

## Results

The predictive model achieved an accuracy of 92%, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying potential cases of heart disease. Detailed results, including precision, recall, and F1 score, are available in the analysis notebook.
